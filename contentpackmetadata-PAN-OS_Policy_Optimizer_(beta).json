All of these are easily customizable to suit the needs of your organization.\n\n_For more information, visit our [PAN-OS Policy Optimizer docs page](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/packs/policy-optimizer)._\n\n![Policy_Optimizer_-_Manage_Unused_Rules](https://github.com/demisto/content/raw/82df056cff9dc4ce8b0753b341a4434593fa4608/Packs/PANOSPolicyOptimizer/doc_files/Policy_Optimizer_-_Manage_Unused_Rules.png?raw=true)\n\n### Pack Contributors:\n\n---\n - Maciej Drobniuch\n\nContributions are welcome and appreciated.
